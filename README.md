This is a [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) based build process for editing [userChrome.css](https://www.userchrome.org/)  
It's uses [scss](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) to allow for modularity and splitting code into multiple files. 

It also uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to pull in other people's projects like [UserChromeTweaks](https://github.com/Timvde/UserChrome-Tweaks).
